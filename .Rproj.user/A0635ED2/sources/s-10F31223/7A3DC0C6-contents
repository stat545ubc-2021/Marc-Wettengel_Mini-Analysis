# Task 1: Process and sumarize data

## 1.1 Research questions from milestone 1

### 1. How does tree density vary in each neighbourhood?

### 2. Are there patterns to the distribution of evergreens vs. deciduous species in Vancouver's neighbourhoods?

### 3. Are there relationships, and are they differences between genus, between the year planted and the diameter of the trees?

### 4. Are certain trees more likely to be found on specific streets of Vancouver? Moreover, are there random patterns,  relationships such as taller trees being located on odd or even side street names?
