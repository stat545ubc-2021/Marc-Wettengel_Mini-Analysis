"0","# for question 1 I just want to select all variables I will need as I don't know the proper mutate() command to finish tidying my data set.
vantreeQ1 <- vantreeM3 %>%
  select(genus_name, #including genus name just in case!
         neighbourhood_name,
         longitude,
         latitude) %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_name) %>%
  count(neighbourhood_name))
"
"2","Error: unexpected ')' in:
""  group_by(neighbourhood_name) %>%
  count(neighbourhood_name))""
"
