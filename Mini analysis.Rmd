#1 Choosing a data set

##1.1
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

From reading the descriptions of the various datasets included in the 'datateachr' package, these 4 data sets are of most interest to me:

1.vancouver_trees
2.flow_sample
3.parking_meters
4.building_permits

##1.2 exploring attributes of data 

```{r}
head(vancouver_trees)
```

```{r}
head(flow_sample)
```

```{r}
head(parking_meters)
```

```{r}
head(building_permits)
```

##1.3
The two datasets that strike the most interest to me are Vancouver_trees and flow_sample. vancouver_trees provides a lot of unique variables, including location which can allow for spatial analysis. flow_sample I find to be interesting since it's including extreme events and it has a time dimenstion. 

##1.4 
Both of these data sets create various unique questions, but based on my personal interests and background knowledge I find myself more intreigued by the vancouver_trees dataset.
